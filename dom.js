//1) In your "week5" repo, in your practice branch, create a new "index.html" and a "dom.js". Make sure your index.html has everything its suppose to in the head, and that your js is linked too.
//2) In your index.html create a list with at least 3 items under it.
//3) use JS to change the styles of each of the elements in your list (can be as basic as .color).
//4) Change the class name of your second item in your list using child (in js).
//5) Change the text value of your last item in your list using sibling (in js).
//6) Create a second list with a list inside of it (nested list). Each list should have at least 2 items. Add a button to the bottom of the page (make sure it's not in a list).
//7) Create an event listener that is listening for the button click. When the event is triggered, have one the elements in the innermost list change it's display to hidden.
//8) Look at how the event is propagating through the lists/body of your HTML. Does it make sense to do this in another way?
